        maybe you could hurt me<br>
        Hurt me just a little<br>
        To help me ease the pain<br>
        Or maybe you could kill me<br>
        One to the back of the head<br>
        Just leave me in the rain<br>
        Or what if we decided<br>
        Instead we’d hold each other<br>
        For a little while<br>
        But maybe forever
      </p>
      <p>
        And maybe we’d be the fifty percent<br>
        That didn’t quite make it<br>
        Or maybe we could have it all<br>
        Twenty kids and a picket<br>
        And maybe..
      </p>
      <p>
        We could live near the beach<br>
        In a tall, tall mountain<br>
        Johnson and sea grass<br>
        Floating like ribbons<br>
        Seagulls would fly overhead<br>
        We would dance to our music<br>
        We would worry about nothing<br>
        We have time for that when we’re dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it’s a little<br>
        Silly fantasy of mine<br>
        But we could build our home<br>
        In the thickets and vines<br>
        No one around to bother us<br>
        No one to bring us harm<br>
        Just me and our beach home<br>
        And you to keep me warm..<br>
        oh..
      </p>
      <p>
        We could live near the beach<br>
        In a tall, tall mountain<br>
        Johnson and sea grass<br>
        Floating like ribbons<br>
        Seagulls would fly overhead<br>
        We would dance to our music<br>
        We would worry about nothing<br>
        We have time for that when we’re dead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it<br>
        So<br>
        Much to ask<br>
        For an ending that isn’t so bitter<br>
        As the last?<br>
        Is it<br>
        Too<br>
        Hard<br>
        To maintain something like this with getting bored?
      </p>
      <p>
        not if we live near the beach<br>
        In a tall, tall mountain<br>
        Johnson and sea grass<br>
        Floating like ribbons<br>
        Seagulls would fly overhead<br>
        We would dance to our music<br>
        We would worry about nothing<br>
        We have time for that when we’re dead.
